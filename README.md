    new Day(Day::MONDAY, [
        new TimePeriod('08:00', '12:00'),
        new TimePeriod('13:00', '17:00'),
    ]),
    new Day(Day::TUESDAY, [
        new TimePeriod('08:00', '12:00'),
        new TimePeriod('13:00', '17:00'),
    ]),
    new Day(Day::WEDNESDAY, [
        new TimePeriod('08:00', '12:00'),
        new TimePeriod('13:00', '17:00'),
    ]),
    new Day(Day::THURSDAY, [
        new TimePeriod('08:00', '12:00'),
        new TimePeriod('13:00', '17:00'),
    ]),
    new Day(Day::FRIDAY, [
        new TimePeriod('08:00', '12:00'),
        new TimePeriod('13:00', '17:00'),
    ]),
    new Day(Day::SATURDAY, [
        new TimePeriod('08:00', '12:00'),
    ]),
]));

$openingHourChecker->isOpenOn(Day::TUESDAY); // true
$openingHourChecker->isOpenOn(Day::SUNDAY); // false

# 2016-10-10 is on a monday.
$openingHourChecker->isOpenAt(
    \DateTime::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s', '2016-10-10 10:00:00')
)); // returns true

$openingHourChecker->isOpenAt(
    \DateTime::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s', '2016-10-10 12:30:00')
)); // returns false
```
